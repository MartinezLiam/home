		<p> For a long period of time, Paris did not have a football club that belonged to them. 
		This changed when a couple of businessmen thought out the plan of merging Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain
		into a single club that would be named Paris Saint-Germain. (The year of establishment is somewhat debated
		because the club was affiliated with the Federation Francaise de football already in December 1969)

		<h2 id = "Identity"> Identity </h2>
		<p> Since the creation of the club PSG has represented the city of Paris and the neighbouring royal
		town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. This resulted in the club's traditional colours being red, blue, and
		white. Red and blue are Parisian colours, and white is a symbol of French royalty and
		Saint-Germain-en-Laye. On the club's logo, the Eiffel tower in red and blue represents Paris, and
		the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleur-de-lis"> fluer de lys </a> is a royal symbol 
 		being related to Saint-Germain-en-Laye. <img src = "lo.jpeg" alt = "Picture of logo for PSG" width = "600" height = "350"/>

		to Ligue 1 in 1979. During the early years of the team, PSG played on several grounds which include
		<a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Municipal_Georges_Lef%C3%A8vre"> Stade Municipal Georges Lef√®vre </a>
